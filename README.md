This project implements a serverless text generation solution using AWS services, specifically Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda, to create dynamic blog content based on user-provided topics. The generated content is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for easy retrieval and further use. The project leverages a Bedrock language model to generate the blog content and uses Lambda to automate the processing and storage, making it scalable and efficient for content creation use cases
